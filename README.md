# Spam-mail-prediction

# Overview

The "Spam Mail Prediction" project aims to build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). This project utilizes a dataset of labeled SMS messages to train and evaluate the model.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains two columns:

- `Category`: The label for the message, with possible values being "ham" (non-spam) and "spam".
- `Message`: The content of the SMS message.

# Sample Data

Below are the first few rows of the dataset:
